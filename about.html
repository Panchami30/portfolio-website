With a background in Civil Engineering, I have honoured my skills in building solid drafting background, crafting compelling content, and driving engagement. I have 7 years of experience in the field of modelling and drawing shop fabrication drawings and understand the complex architectural drawings.
I have secured the Bachelors in Civil Engineering.
I am transitioning from a background in civil engineering to pursue my passion for technology, specifically in DevOps and cloud engineering. I have been actively building my skills through AWS-Devops courses, and I am excited to bring my problem-solving mindset and engineering experience into the tech space.
